Okay so this is a restart of my whole project. I could not make
my button clicks register even though I tried for hours and hours with 
different code and solutions.


I restarted project, built the HTML, CSS and JS with more care and...the 
problem was still occcuring. In desperation I made a CodePen to send
it to my friend for some advice and everything was working fine there.

I realised to my horror the problem had been related to the loading order
and the fact that I had not defered my script tags or placed at the bottom. Silly mistake.

The problem is now solved, on the plus side it made me go back through my code and make it cleaner
so I will carry on with this project, and make sure I don't make that
mistake ever again hahah.



The idea of this game is to make a Rock Paper Scissors game
and to change the options to Earth, Wind and Fire. They are a bit more fun than the 
standard options and the best part is I have an excuse to fit some music from the band Earth, Wind and Fire in. 
Do you remember? The 21st niiiight
